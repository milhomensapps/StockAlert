# Stock Alert Repository
This repository contains the shared files of the Stocks Alert Formula App from Milhomens Apps.

You can get the app from  Google Play at:
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cat.obiols.milhomens.BorsaValors

You can add a market to the list at the markets.xml file and you can update the stocks from a market it the files defined in the other files. Once done, make me a pull request and if everything is all right, I will include it.

*Symbols* contained in every file, *have to match with* the symbols that uses *Yahoo Finance*.

For example:  Grifols Symbol at the Mercado Continuo is  GRF.MC .
The URL to get Grifols information would be  http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=GRF.MC
